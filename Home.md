## Welcome to the orientdb-docs wiki!

We collected all the WiKi pages from most of the projects under Orient Technologies umbrella in just one place. If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, please send an email to **info - at - orientechnologies.com** specifying:
- Your GitHub account name
- Which area you'd like to contribute
- A short description about you and how you have used OrientDB

These are the rules to become a contributor:
- documentation must be in English only. Many of the contributors are not English mother tongue, so apologize in advance if you find poor English here. You could help also on fixing how pages are written. This would be very welcome.
- don't use a disrespectful or offensive language 
- links to external web-sites are forbidden, but wikipedia.com
- don't use this page to publicize your product or company

Thanks in advance,

OrientDB Team
