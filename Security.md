|![](images/warning.png)|Even thought OrientDB Server is a regular Web Server, it is not recommended to expose it directly on the Internet or public networks. We suggest to always hide OrientDB server in a private network.|

OrientDB is the NoSQL with more focus on security then everyone else. 

To connect to an existent database, a user and password is needed. Users (and roles) are defined inside the database. For more information look at [Database security](Database-Security.md). If you're connecting to a OrientDB Server that is hosting a database, you could access to the database by using a server's user. For more information look at [Server security](Server-Security.md). If you need your database content is encrypted on disk, look at [Database Encryption](Database-Encryption.md).
