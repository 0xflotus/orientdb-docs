# OrientJS Class API

Once you have initialized a database instance, you can use it to access and manipulate classes in OrientDB, through the OrientJS Class API.  This allows you to work with the database schema, in the event that you want to use a schema.

Methods for the Class API are accessible through the `db.class` object.
