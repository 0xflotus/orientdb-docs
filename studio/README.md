# Introduction

_Studio_ is a web interface for the administration of OrientDB that comes in bundle with the OrientDB distribution. 

If you run OrientDB in your local machine the web interface can be accessed via the URL:

```
http://localhost:2480
```

To access Studio on a remote machine, you may want to use an SSH tunnel.

The following is a screen-shot of the Home Page of Studio v.{{book.currentVersion}}:
